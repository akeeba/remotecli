# Akeeba Remote CLI

The command line tool to take and download backups remotely using Akeeba Backup for Joomla!, Akeeba Backup for WordPress and Akeeba Solo.

## Important note on the Akeeba Backup JSON API support status

This is one of the two official and supported clients for the Akeeba Backup JSON API, the other being Akeeba UNiTE.

Akeeba Ltd does not provide any kind of support whatsoever for unofficial, third party consumers of the Akeeba Backup JSON API.

## API versions

Only the Akeeba Backup v2 API is officially supported.

While this tool lets you use it with sites on very old (released before August 2021) versions of Akeeba Backup and Akeeba Solo which still use the v1 API, this support is considered deprecated and will go away without warning.
