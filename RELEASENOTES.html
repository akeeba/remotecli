<h3>What's new</h3>
<p>
    <strong>The software was rewritten</strong>. We have rewritten Remote CLI to ensure compatibility with future
    versions of the remote JSON API included in Akeeba Backup and Akeeba Solo. Furthermore, it is now better suited for
    communicating with Akeeba Backup for WordPress and Akeeba Solo without triggering weird issues on few, badly
    configured servers.
</p>

<h3>PHP 5.5.0 or later (incl. 5.5, 5.6) or PHP 7 is required</h3>
<p>
    Remote CLI is compatible with PHP 5.4.0 and later versions, including
    5.5, 5.6 and the newest versions of PHP, 7.0, 7.1 and 7.2.
    We'd like to remind you that this requirement refers only to our software. The sites which can be restored by our
    software may not support all of the aforementioned PHP versions. Please check the requirements of your site's
    software before restoring it on a different host / server to avoid issues due to PHP version incompatibilities.
