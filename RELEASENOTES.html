<h3>PHP 5.5.0 or later</h3>
<p>
    Remote CLI is compatible with PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4.
    We'd like to remind you that this requirement refers only to our software. The sites which can be backed
    up or restored by our  software may not support all of the aforementioned PHP versions. Please check the
    requirements of your site's  software before restoring it on a different host / server to avoid issues
    due to PHP version incompatibilities.
