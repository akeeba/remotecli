<h3>What's new?</h3>

<p>
    <strong>Now using our Akeeba Backup JSON API Client Library (https://github.com/akeeba/json-backup-api) under the hood</strong>. This is merely a reorganisation of our code base to allow all three of our products making use of the Akeeba Backup JSON API (Remote CLI, UNiTE, and Panopticon) to use the same codebase. There are no functional changes compared to version 3.0.0.
